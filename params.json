Part of this is due to the fact that when people decide to drive, they do not realize how drunk they are, or that they are actively getting more drunk as they are driving due to the amount of alcohol they have consumed. We hope that through our experience, users can learn about the dangers of drinking and driving, and feel a bit of the damage that they could cause when they get behind the wheel after drinking.\r\nWe used the concept of peer pressure to try and get people to drink who otherwise would not. Other VR projects use the concept of peer pressure through bullying to push a user towards making a bad decision. \r\n\r\nIn our project, the user is peer pressured, and then presented with a quick decision that involves driving. In real life, many people might overlook the situation because of the dire situation presented by the decision and decide to drive when they are a danger to themselves and others.\r\n\r\n### Description of Situation\r\nThe participant starts out at a house party. At this party, the participant has the ability to interact with various elements in the scene, such as a bar and other party guests. At the bar, the bartender will ask if the participant wishes to have a drink, to which the participant can accept or decline. If the participant wishes to speak with the party guests, a particular guest will encourage the participant to consume more alcohol. If the participant declines the guest’s offer, the guest will pressure the user to take the drink. Therefore, in this scene, we have both choices to be made under intimidation and pressure-free choices.\r\n\r\nIf the participant chooses to drive in order to save time and try and reach the hospital faster:\r\n- If the participant had nothing to drink then the scene will transition to a hospital scene.\r\n- If the participant had something to drink, they will enter a driving scene that gradually inverts the controls making it harder and harder to drive. Also the view will become blurred, ultimately resulting in a crash. \r\n - Depending on the number of drinks that the user took previously there will be a crash scene with a virtual human on the floor that the user “killed” or not.\r\n - After some time the crash scene will transition to a jail scene where the participant is placed for driving while intoxicated.\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\nThe average person metabolizes alcohol at the rate of about one drink per hour.\r\n\r\nEvery two minutes, a person is injured in a drunk driving crash.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/about/drunk-driving-statistics.html\r\n\r\n### Assets\r\n* Characters - Mixamo.com\r\n* Police Car and Helicopter - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/52496\r\n* Sports Car - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12133\r\n* White Car - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/45368\r\n* Fire – https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36825\r\n* Road - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/52628\r\n* Hospital beds and trolley - http://u3d.as/iSp\r\n* Hospital computer, ceiling fan, chairs, and windows - http://u3d.as/3Ps\r\n* Hospital wood flooring - http://www.textures.com/download/woodfine0038/33549\r\n* Party room sofas - http://u3d.as/hbU\r\n* Party Pack: beer, balloons, champagne bottle and glasses, table, flooring, wallpapers - http://u3d.as/1Ub\r\n\r\n### Video Link\r\n\r\n### Zipfile\r\n\r\n### Member Responsibilities\r\nSabrina\r\n- Character and animations\r\n- Logic for Drink/Bullying\r\n- Canvas functionality\r\n\r\nMegan\r\n- Creation of Party and Hospital Scene\r\n- Animations\r\n- Lighting\r\n\r\nNoah\r\n- Driving Scene\r\n- Faders\r\n- Crash Scene\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
