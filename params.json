  "body": "### Project 4 Drink Driving\r\nMany people may underestimate the dangers of drinking and driving. Part of this is due to the fact that when people decide to drive, they do not realize how drunk they are, or that they are actively getting more drunk as they are driving due to the amount of alcohol they have consumed. We hope that through our experience, users can learn about the dangers of drinking and driving, and feel a bit of the damage that they could cause when they get behind the wheel after drinking.\r\nWe used the concept of peer pressure to try and get people to drink who otherwise would not. Other VR projects use the concept of peer pressure through bullying to push a user towards making a bad decision. \r\n\r\nIn our project, the user is peer pressured, and then presented with a quick decision that involves driving. In real life, many people might overlook the situation because of the dire situation presented by the decision and decide to drive when they are a danger to themselves and others.\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\nThe average person metabolizes alcohol at the rate of about one drink per hour.\r\n\r\nEvery two minutes, a person is injured in a drunk driving crash.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/about/drunk-driving-statistics.html\r\n\r\n### Assets\r\nCharacters - Mixamo.com\r\nPolice Car and Helicopter - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/52496\r\nSports Car - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12133\r\nWhite Car - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/45368\r\nFire â€“ https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36825\r\nRoad - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/52628\r\n\r\n### Video Link\r\n\r\n### Zipfile\r\n\r\n### Member Responsibilities\r\nSabrina\r\n- Character and animations\r\n- Logic for Drink/Bullying\r\n- Canvas functionality\r\n\r\nMegan\r\n- Creation of Party and Hospital Scene\r\n- Animations\r\n\r\nNoah\r\n- Driving Scene\r\n- Faders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
